Everyone in our group loves watching movies, and we tend to look at reviews when deciding on watching a film to check the quality and see whether it's worth
watching. Since there are numerous review sites, with each having their own differing opinion on many films, we would like to examine the differences in user
preference between the sources. We would also like to examine the popularity of the sources and how it affects the preferences of their respective users. Uncovering
these preferences will better  allow us to interpret movie ratings on these websites.
    
Our project includes the usage of data science techniques, to collect, store, clean, and plotting the data to conduct analysis. 
    
A flow chart outlining our project plan:

To make our analysis more advanced and critical, we designed a composite score for each movie. The composite score consisted of 4 factors: the user rating, the
number of users voted, the revenue and the year. The purpose of this is to level off our data, and give a more layered analysis.

    <summary><h2 style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: middle;">Wikipedia/ Rotten Tomatoes(RT)</h2></summary>

For Rotten Tomatoes, our approach was to leverage data from a Wikipedia article featuring films with 100% ratings. We initially gathered a larger pool of 424 films and later refined it to our target 250, keeping in mind that these ratings did not equate to 100% user ratings.

To facilitate data analysis and maintain consistency with the other data sources, we had to perform several data cleaning steps. This included the standardization of revenue and movie runtimes, and the transformation of the number of votes into brackets.

We also developed a composite score for each movie, which was calculated considering both user ratings and revenue. Additionally, we tried to score directors based on the average composite scores of their movies and their number of films in the list. However, after feedback, we decided to focus more on comparing sources than analyzing individual directors.

Data was then compiled in a dataframe with key features including the rating, director, revenue, users voted, the data source and the year. All features were adjusted to match the format and data types used by our teammates for IMDb and TMDB data, ensuring a seamless concatenation process.

<h5>Data Collection Challenges</h5>

The most significant challenge we encountered with Rotten Tomatoes data was ensuring homogeneity and comparability with other sources. This is because RT has a large international presense, so it was especially tricky when dealing with different currencies in revenue and trying to remove non-US flims.

  <details>
    <summary><h2 style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: middle;">TMDB</h2></summary>

For TMDB, first the API was used to get the top 250 movies and their IDs. The ID was used to get all the key information of an individual film (e.g., revenue, director) in a json requests format. As numerous films in TMDB had missing revenue values, IMDb was used to fill in the missing values where possible (TMDB API also gave the IMDb ID of each film). Most films had multiple genres and some with multiple directors, so the genres and directors for those films were stored in a list. When we wanted to separate the data by genre or director, we used the pandas df.explode() function to do so.

Data was then compiled in a dataframe. The variables used included: (user) rating, director, revenue, users voted, the data source and the year. 

Rating values were converted into a percentage and votes was converted from a flat number to brackets (since Rotten Tomatoes doesn't have a flat number for the number of users voted), to make the data consistent, so all 3 sites can be easily compared and the dataframes can be concatenated.

  <details>
    <summary><h2 style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: middle;">IMDb</h2></summary> 

We were able to find a list of the top 1000 movies on IMDb by rating. We then took the first 250 movies from this list to use in our project. IMDb was not willing to let us use their API, so the data was collected using webscraping. We collected the movie title, director, year of release, genre, revenue, rating, length, and number of user votes. We then made the rating out of 100 instead of 10 for the sake of comparability. Initially, we created one IMDb df that had only one genre per movie. Later we put all genres in a list and used df.explode() to separate them when necessary. We also bracketed the votes like we did for our TMDB data for ease of comparison.

  <details>
      <summary><h2 style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: middle;">Section 0: Preliminary analysis (unrelated to later sections)</h2></summary>
    
(Our analysis and results section are merged as we felt showing and analyzing each step of our data analysis process for clarity)
<br>
Before we begin, we will show a sample of how we created our analysis by using ggplot(shown below).
    
<img src="https://github.com/j-quinn01/LSE-DS105-Movie-Directors/raw/main/docs/_images/ggplot_code.png" alt="Flow chart">        

 
      
<h3> Now, we will show some preliminary data analysis that are unrelated to sections I, II and III. </h3>

<ul>
<li>While doing some exploratory analysis, we produced the following graph. On the x-axis we have the different vote brackets, on the y-axis we have the average revenue of each interval. </li>
</ul>
      
<img src="https://github.com/j-quinn01/LSE-DS105-Movie-Directors/raw/main/docs/_images/revenue_votes.png" alt="Flow chart">       

<ul>
<li>One would think that as the number of votes increase, the revenue would as well because we expect a positive correlation between the number of votes and the number of people who have seen the movie. And so, the more people who have seen a movie, the higher that movie‚Äôs revenue. We kind of see this trend in the graph, although there is a huge spike in revenue for the 10,000 and 25,000 votes intervals. We were curious about this, so we looked for outliers. After sorting the concatenated df by revenue, we found this.</li>
</ul>
      
<img src="https://github.com/j-quinn01/LSE-DS105-Movie-Directors/raw/main/docs/_images/outlier_df.png" alt="Flow chart">  
<ul>
<li>Both the 10,000 and 25,000 votes intervals have an Avengers movie with very high revenue relative to other movies, which is pushing the average revenues for these movies higher.</li>
      </ul>

<br>
<br>
There seems to be movies from greater variety of directors in RT. The frequency of directors in Rotten Tomatoes does not exceed 3, whilst directors have appeared up to 7 times in TMDB and IMDB.
          
<img src="https://github.com/j-quinn01/LSE-DS105-Movie-Directors/raw/main/docs/_images/t10_directors_each_source.png" alt="Flow chart">       

TMDB's top 250 movies have by far the greatest average revenue, with Rotten Tomatoes with the least. This suggests TMDB users have a preference towards more popular films, whilst Rotten Tomatoes users do not.      
 
<img src="https://github.com/j-quinn01/LSE-DS105-Movie-Directors/raw/main/docs/_images/avg_rev_sources.png" alt="Flow chart">      
          
This suggests TMDB and IMDb users may be biased towards films with a specific director or a higher box office, however the analysis is preliminary and more analysis needs to be conducted in order to make a conclusion.
      
<h2> So far, we have seen how outliers have skewed the average revenue of voting intervals, the variation in the number of directors included in the top 250 movies from each source, and the (large) variation in the average revenue per movie across our three sources. </h2>

          </div>
      </summary>
<ul>
<li>In Part I, we tried to see if we can infer anything from the graphs of average absolute user rating by genre across 3 sources</li>
      </ul>

<br>

 <img src="https://github.com/j-quinn01/LSE-DS105-Movie-Directors/raw/main/docs/_images/rating_boxplots.png" alt="Flow chart"> 

(The boxplot is depicting the same thing as the bar graph, and both show higher average ratings for RT)
<ul>
    <li>We saw that RT users tend to vote more optimistically compared to IMDb and TMDB on average</li>
<li> However, we find no substantial differences/preferences for 1 genre relative to the other within genres by eyeballing the data and seeing how any differences are not consistent across sources, and were minimal fluctuations at best (relative to total ratings)</li>
      </ul>

<br>

Still in part I, we also plotted a graph of the number of top movies by genres so we can see if a source gives "preferential" treatment to those from a different source
      <ul>
<li>(For example, maybe IMDb really likes horror movies. If so, then we should see alot more horror movies!)</li>
      </ul>


 <img src="https://github.com/j-quinn01/LSE-DS105-Movie-Directors/raw/main/docs/_images/section_I_representation_of_movies.png" alt="Flow chart">       



<h4> As we saw from the adjusted graph, there seems to be a HUGE representation of Documentary type movies for just Rotten Tomatoes! </h4>
      <ul>
<li>After doing some adjustment, we found that there is there is alot of Drama movies across all sources (most for IMDb and TMDB, and 2nd for RT)</li>
<li>Potential inferrence might mean that on average, many people like Drama type movies!</li>
<li>However, there might be other confounding variables, like maybe there are just a greater proportion of Drama movies made, so naturally more are highly rated</li>
<li>We can also see the RT does not have movies in certain genres like War, Mystery or Music! However, this is due to the fact that there aren't categories for this on RT</li>
<li>No clear relationship for other genres</li>
      </ul>



<h2> In conclusion, data from user ratings suggest no preference for a certain genre across sources. However, data from represenation of top movies seems to indicate a potential preference for Documentary genres within RT. However, as we would soon find out in section 2, this isn't the case! </h2>

              <h2 style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: middle;">Section II: Examining difference in composite scores, to see if there are any discrepances or patterns in absolute user score, number of voters, absolute revenue and date of release in order to derive conclusions about the sources</h2>
          </div>
      </summary>

First, we began by calculating the overall composite score
<br>
The composite score = function(User composite score, revenue composite score)
<ul>
<li>User composite score = function(absolute user rating, number of users)</li>
<li>Revenue composite score = function(revenue at time of release, year of release)</li> 
      </ul>
Hence, composite score consists of 4 components
      <ul>
    <li>User score</li>
    <li>Number of users who rated</li>
    <li>Revenue</li>
    <li>Date of release (revenue was scaled up due to inflation)</li>
      </ul>

<br>
<br>
We then plot a graph of average overall_composite_movie_score over genre with 3 bar graphs for each data source

<img src="https://github.com/j-quinn01/LSE-DS105-Movie-Directors/raw/main/docs/_images/section_II_absolute_composite_score.png" alt="Flow chart">       

<ul>      
<li>We again find no clear pattern of composite scores within genres</li>
<li>Even the Documentary genre for RT isn't higher than the rest despite over-representation shown earlier</li>
<li>This points to other factors causing over-representation besides the hypothesis that RT users like Documentaries</li>
<li><strong>This gives evidence to refute our initial findings in section 1, that there might be a slight preference for Documentary genres within Rotten Tomatoes sources!</strong></li>
<li>However, we find crucial data (indicated in the graph or a more condensed one below) that RT has the lowest average overall score across all genres (data above graph) followed by TMDB and IMDB.</li>
      </ul>

<img src="https://github.com/j-quinn01/LSE-DS105-Movie-Directors/raw/main/docs/_images/section_II_average_composite_score_mean.png" alt="Flow chart">   


<br>


We then tried to find out which of the 4 components contributed to this trend by sketching appropriate graphs
      <ul>
<li>By plotting a graph of average revenue_score over genre with 3 bar graphs for each data source amoung other things, we can see, RT is the lowest, followed by TMDB and IMDB. This matches the earlier pattern, so revenue explains it!</li>
      </ul>

<img src="https://github.com/j-quinn01/LSE-DS105-Movie-Directors/raw/main/docs/_images/section_II_composite_revenue_graph.png" alt="Flow chart">


<br>

(Graph helps to explain as there are similar "peaks" and trough as compared to the total composite score graph)




<img src="https://github.com/j-quinn01/LSE-DS105-Movie-Directors/raw/main/docs/_images/section_II_composite_revenue_graph_mean.png" alt="Flow chart">      

<br>
(This mean table gives a simpler version of analysis to prove what we're saying above)
<ul>
<li>Since revenue composite score is made up of revenue at time of release (Absolute revenue) and year of release we did further analysis via graphs to see which factor exactly contribues to this trend</li>
      </ul>

<img src="https://github.com/j-quinn01/LSE-DS105-Movie-Directors/raw/main/docs/_images/section_II_years_graph.png" alt="Flow chart">      

<ul>
<li>From the data, (above) we can see that the years are clearly not a factor. The order is reversed and differences minimal</li>
      </ul>

<br>

<strong>This means the differences are attributed primarily to absolute revenue!</strong>

<strong>In other words, while it seems that there is no preference (or conflicting evidence) as to whether there are preferences between genres within or between sources, our data seems to suggest movies with a higher absolute revenue are over-represented in IMDb and TMDB relative to Rotten Tomatoes!</strong>

<strong>A possible explanation could be that IMDb and TMDB are more popular sites than Rotten Tomatoes. Hence, movies with higher revenues (and hence more overall customers), visit sites like IMDb and TMDB more relative to RT! (obviously, this is just a hypothesis. Correlation =/= causation)</strong>



We next examined user composite score and see the same pattern of (RT -> TMDB -> IMDb) for user composite score

<img src="https://github.com/j-quinn01/LSE-DS105-Movie-Directors/raw/main/docs/_images/s2_comp_user_graph.png" alt="Flow chart">      


(graph showing composite user score)
<br>
<br>
<br>

<img src="https://github.com/j-quinn01/LSE-DS105-Movie-Directors/raw/main/docs/_images/s2_comp_user.png" alt="Flow chart">      

<br>
(table showing mean user score)
<br>
<ul>
<li>However, data/graph seems to only partially confirm this as only some patterns are explained but not others in the graph</li>
<li><strong>Taken together, it seems that the composite user rating score only partially explains the lower average total score for RT, but doesn't explain to the same extent as revenue composite!</strong></li>
<li>This is because while the means follow the same pattern, the "peaks" and "troughs" of the data from user composite don't follow the same pattern as overall composite!</li>
      </ul>
<br>

<br>
We next analysed the data to see which of the 2 components in user composite (user rating or number of voters) contribute to the trend

<br>

<img src="https://github.com/j-quinn01/LSE-DS105-Movie-Directors/raw/main/docs/_images/s2_absolute_user_mean.png" alt="Flow chart">      

<br>

<ul>
<li>The data seems obvious that absolute ratings aren't the reason contributing to the composite user rating order between sources as the order there doesn't match the order previously (instead of RT being lowest and IMDb being highest, now RT is highest)</li>
    <li><strong>Instead, it seems like the number of voters are the major reason!</strong></li>
    <li>It seems that it is <strong>number of voters</strong> &  <strong>absolute revenue</strong> that explains the trend we see in composite user rating and overall composite score</li>
      </ul>

<h2><strong>To summarise, while it seems that there is no preference (or conflicting evidence) as to whether there are preferences between genres within or between sources, our data seems to suggest movies with a higher absolute revenue are over-represented in IMDb and TMDB relative to Rotten Tomatoes! Hence, this supports the idea that IMDb and TMDB are more popular sites than Rotten Tomatoes! If IMDb and TMDB are more popular, those sites would get more voters for popular movies. Indeed, this is what we see!</strong></h2>

<br>
      
* Note again here, this is just a hypothesis. Correlation =/= causation. Reverse casuality might happen here - perhaps because there are more votes on sites like IMDb and TMDB, they become more popular with mainstream and casual audiences, which explains why movies with higher revenus (that are frequented by mainstream audiences, go to those sites leading to over representation of high revenue movies in IMDb and TMDB.)

</details>

<details>
    <summary><h2 style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: middle;">üñãÔ∏è Conclusion</h2></summary>
<ul>
<li>In conclusion, we think there is no strong evidence that there is a preference for a genre within or across sources</li>
<li>Examining the graph of absolute user ratings over genres over 3 sources, we see that there is no significant pattern of preference for a single genre within sources(as variations are relatively small) & across sources (no pattern across sources)</li>
<li>We also plotted a graph showing representation of movies by genre from an essentially random sample (we collected data using a similar approach for all 3 - collecting data from top movies as indicated by the source itself)</li>
<li>While it seems like RT users might have a preference for that Documentary movies, as they are over-represented, the data from absolute user scores and later composite user and composite overall scores suggest otherwise</li>
    </ul>

<h2> This points to the fact that there is no preference for genres within or across sources. </h2>

However, our data shows support for the hypothesis that IMDb and TMDB are more popular compared to RT. This is because of three reasons:
   <ul> 
    <li>IMDb and TMDB have, on average, a greater representation of higher grossing flims than RT even as their average release year across sources are similar (evidence 1)</li>
    <li>IMDb and TMDB have, on average, more voters than RT even as their average absolute user rating is about the same (evidence 2)</li>
    <li>IMDb and TMDB represent a significantly greater proportion of modern flims compared to RT (evidence 3)</li>
    </ul>

<h3> All this evidence suggests that IMDb and TMDB are more popular sites in modern times than RT. With a greater popularity, more viewers vote (evidence 2).  Moreover, as movies with higher revenues are ones that attract more customers, more popular sites will have more traffic to those movies, leading to them being over-represented as top movies in IMDb and TMDB (evidence 1). The relative popularity of IMDb and TMDB also seems to be validated especially in the modern era, as traffic for modern movies for RT is lower compared to IMDb and TMDB, leading to IMDb and TMDB representing a greater % of higher performing flims compared to RT (evidence 3). </h3>
